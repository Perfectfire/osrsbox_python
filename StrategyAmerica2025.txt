	Canada
		Buy Land?-  While conditions are still good. Live on the land.
			$150k For 100 Acres?
		Buy House (Use as satellite)
		Camping in National Forest - Great for when conditions worsen in the nation
			Must look up laws
			Typically allowed to hunt, fish, camp, etc
			Idea:
				Stay in small groups 4-8 people
				Find off-the-road roads and 2-tracks, go down them and then park
				Stay 500 meters apart
				Don't stay in same area for more than a week if encounter unknown other people (especially if odd encounter of if more than once) (abide by natural camping rules: act as if you are camping)
				No loud music
				NO large fires
				Bury all supplies - do not leave many traces - do not get caught burying supplies (bring tarp & cover up if others approach, possibly do at dusk so less visible)!
				If national conditions worsen, rules are probably a lot less worrisome
				Buy Storage Unit in Town (save $ - no need to buy land or a house)
					Travel back and forth to resupply
					if Squatting, Unload storage unit into area
						1| Get Hotel in town to stock up on supplies ($7000 - $500/night for 2 weeks)
						2| rent storage unit to put supplies in ($70/month)
						3| stock up storage unit with supplies over the 2 weeks
						4| Find camping location
						5| transport everything from storage unit to camping location over 2 weeks, then end subscription to storage unit
					if Camping, Keep Storage unit active
						1| Travel back and forth to resupply (almost free camping)
						get hotel once in a while when needing to resupply storage unit.
								Fuel Cost:
									$8/trip (80-min round trip)
						obtain a mailing address
				
				Travel back and forth to satellite house to resupply
				
				To obtain a physical mailing address:
					Use address at original home location
					Establish a permanent address by renting a mailbox
					Use a virtual mailbox service
					Use a friend's or family's address.
					For a property: Apply for one with the local government, often through the post office or planning and zoning department. 
			
				
				
	Canada
		All get Visa ASAP

		Plenty of Forests, Western Canada. Don't need to go too North.

	Growing
		Potatoes (filling to eat, grow in dirt)
			(Need: Sunny area, use "certified disease-free seed potatoes", 12-16 inch apart, place seed potatoes with sprouts pointing upwards)
			Watering and Hilling:
				Aim for about 1 inch of water per week
			Hilling:
				As the potato plants grow, "hill" them by covering the stems with soil or straw, creating mounds around the plants. 
				Hilling protects the developing potatoes from sunlight, preventing them from turning green and becoming inedible. 
				Keep hilling the plants every time the stems grow another 6-8 inches, until they flower. 
				Harvest when foliage starts to die back and turn brown.
				
		Herbs: Add Flavor, Nutrition
			Dill
			Parsley
			Basil

	Dig Hole --> Put water in for bathing / Soap (unless river)
	Need 5-Gallon Buckets (4 buckets)
	Need Drinking Water Containers / Big Water Bottles
	Chlorine Tablets / Purification Methods
		Bleach - Out of Question. Chlorine Bleach: Use unscented household bleach containing 5.25% sodium hypochlorite. 
			Add the appropriate amount (e.g., a few drops per quart) and allow it to sit for the recommended contact time (30 minutes). 
		(?) needs research: Iodine: Iodine tablets or solutions can kill bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, but may not be effective against Cryptosporidium. 
		Chlorine Dioxide: Chlorine dioxide tablets are another option for disinfection. 
			Brand: "potable aqua" (try ebay, local stores, maybe not amazon due to shipping problem)
	
	Need Drinking Water Disperser Containers w/ Tap
		5-gallon plastic jug w/ tap
	
		Gravity-Fed Water Purifier
			Alexapure Water Filter System
				Comes with A metal container that drains through a filter and disperses water through a tap
					https://www.beprepared.com/products/alexapure-pro-water-filtration-system
		
	What is the most practical way to purify water from a dirty, stagnant pond?
		1. Boil 2. Strain thru cloth 3. Filter 4. Chemical : I would typically do 2-4 in that instance, unless thereâ€™s a dead animal or something in the water.
		I'd make a pouch out of my shirt, fill it with gravel, sand, and charcoal. Run it through there a couple times then boil it.
			Get a 2ft by 3ft dirt screen
				Dig hole in ground to set in bucket, use landscaping blocks to hold up screen above ground
				Layer gravel, sand, charcoal on screen
				Get wood or material and build walls around screen so gravel, sand, and charcoal do not fall off the edges.
					1" thick layer of gravel (replace every 6 month) (top)
						2x 40-lb bags
					1" sand (replace every 6 month) (middle)
						2x 40-lb bags
					1" activated carbon charcoal powder (bottom): 
						3" thick, circle size of water bucket, lasts 6 months to a year
						2 lb bag of charcoal per 6 month (28 lb of charcoal)
					
				Pour water through it a couple times
				Boil the water after
				
				Put water in Plastic Containers
				Place plastic containers in river or lake to cool.
				
		
	Need 1 liter / 0.26 Gallons a day
		~1 pot of water a day
			Boil 1/2 pot of water twice a day.
		

Sewage
    Dig large hole for everyone.
	Each person dig small hole for themselves. Use same area each time. Use shovel when done and move sewage to large hole.

Toilet Paper
	Use leafs when possible. Plan for using leafs 6 months of the year.
	Toilet Paper - 1 roll per 7 days a person ( 4 rolls a month).
	4 rolls/month = 48 rolls/year
	$2.16/roll = $8.67/month = $104.04/year ($728.28 total)
	Cut costs in half if use leafs half a year (52.02/year // 364.14 total).

5| Jesus Returned

	
	Jesus returned, and we are at 2025 where Deagle predicted 100 million americans in America. The war in Israel is growing, too. 
	
	I think we're in for a lot this year. In the past couple years, there has been a lot of new gang violence in inner cities. 
	If we enter the war, oil will go up and the economy will begin reversing. There is a shipping problem that started in April that is now making its landing. 
	It makes sense that the time to relocate to a rural area is soon.
